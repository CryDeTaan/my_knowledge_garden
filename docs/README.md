# Introduction

It seams my memory is at a rudimentary stage of evolution and trying to remember many things and for long periods of time is futile. 
I am started this wiki and call it my knowledge garden where I make notes I learn or read which I can reference in future, albeit slower than my :brain:, its definitely more reliable. 

::: tip INTENTION
I intend to digest something every other day which I will then try to add to my knowledge garden :crossed_fingers:

## Technicals - for those interested

For my knowledge garden I use a minimally configure VuePress site, which I push to GitHub and let netlify take care of the rest.

To add additional pages, it is as simple as adding a new `.md` file to the **mkg** directory. Add content using Markdown, see the VuePress [Markdown Extensions](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html) for more information, and use lots of these :tada: :art: :100:
